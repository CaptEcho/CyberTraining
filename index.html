        <h1>CyberTraining Game for Nuclear Power Plant Workers</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is necessary for a nuclear power plant to continue to function. Hackers regularly assault all sorts of
            infrastructure, organizations, and much more around the world. In fact, cyber attacks on nuclear power plants have 
            already occurred. For example, Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm, was used to target Iran's nuclear power plant 
            infrastructure, outright damaging or even destroying existing infrastructure.
            <br><br>
            As such, it is absolutely necessary cybersecurity workers at the nuclear power plant are fully prepared for any 
            potential scenario. That is the purpose of this game.
